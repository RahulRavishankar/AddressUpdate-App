### Theme 1: Problem Statement 1
Whenever a person moves to a new location, he/she could land up in a situation, wherein he/she would need to provide his/her updated Aadhaar to apply for a Broadband connection. When there is no supporting documentation to prove his/her current address, as per the current policy, Aadhaar requires a supporting Proof of Address (PoA) document or an Introducer who can lend his address to update the personâ€™s address in Aadhaar. We intend to solve this problem.

### API Usage 
*All APIs are disabled post hackathon submission*

- **Auth API** - This API will be used to authenticate the Requester/Introducer while logging in.

- **OTP API** - This API will be used to generate OTP for Requester/Introducer whose mobile number is registered with his/her Aadhaar number. The generated OTP will then be used for authentication.

- **Offline e-KYC API** - This API will be used to retrieve the address of the Introducer from the CIDR. This will then be previewed by the Introducer before giving his/her consent.

- **Distance Matrix API** - This Google Maps API will verify address provided by the Introducer and modified address by the Requester. If the distance between the two addresses is less than 20 metres, verfication is successful.

- **SendGrid API** - This API is utilized to notify the introducer via email regarding an address update request from a requester
