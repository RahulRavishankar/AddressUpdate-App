### Theme 1: Problem Statement 1
Whenever a person moves to a new location, he/she could land up in a situation, wherein he/she would need to provide his/her updated Aadhaar to apply for a Broadband connection. When there is no supporting documentation to prove his/her current address, as per the current policy, Aadhaar requires a supporting Proof of Address (PoA) document or an Introducer who can lend his address to update the personâ€™s address in Aadhaar. We intend to solve this problem.

### Tech Stack
Frontend has been developed using ReactJS and Axios.
Backend has been developed using Java SpringBoot.


### API Usage 
**Auth API** - This API will be used to authenticate the Requester/Introducer while logging in.

**OTP API** - This API will be used to generate OTP for Requester/Introducer whose mobile number is registered with his/her Aadhaar number. The generated OTP will then be used for authentication.

**Offline e-KYC API** - This API will be used to retrieve the address of the Introducer from the CIDR. This will then be previewed by the Introducer before giving his/her consent.

**GeoCode API** - This API will verify address provided by the Introducer and modified address by the Requester. If the distance between the two addresses is less than 20 metres, verfication is successful.
